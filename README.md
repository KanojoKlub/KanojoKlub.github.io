Mike. Editor.  Made for RITCS Royal Institute of Theatre, Cinema and Sound as part of my 2nd year solo project. More so a companion piece to my original pitch for the project, where I used performance art to speak of my interest in Jungian psychology and its use of the Persona, Shadow and the Self, combined with the fear of taking risks in a world where success and a stable lifestyle are constantly being pressured onto one's future. I made this track in FL Studio to further reflect the juxtaposition of the complexity and innocence of such mindset. Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible.
